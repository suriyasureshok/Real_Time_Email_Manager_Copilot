The Real-Time Customer Support Copilot is an AI-powered system that automatically ingests customer messages from multiple channels (emails, website chat, social media) and provides smart insights or responses using NLP and Agentic AI.

The system uses a Master Agent to orchestrate multiple Worker Agents, each specializing in a task: intent classification, sentiment detection, knowledge retrieval, and response generation.

The project is designed to be production-ready:

Real-time streaming with Kafka

Async, modular Python architecture

Scalable and containerized

Observability with logs, metrics, and dashboards

2️⃣ Key Features

Multi-Channel Ingestion

Email (IMAP)

Website Chat (via FastAPI endpoints)

Optional social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)

Agentic AI Orchestration

Master Agent:

Receives events from Kafka

Orchestrates worker agents asynchronously

Maintains per-session memory

Worker Agents:

IntentAgent → classifies the type of query

SentimentAgent → determines tone (positive, neutral, negative, frustration)

KnowledgeAgent → retrieves answers from internal docs or vector DB

ResponseAgent → generates human-like responses

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Semantic search of company knowledge base

Embeddings stored in a vector database (Qdrant, Weaviate, or FAISS)

Supports multi-turn context and summarization

Real-Time Dashboard

Visualizes customer queries, intents, sentiment, trends

Tracks agent activity and response statistics

Filters by channel, topic, and sentiment

Optional: alerting for urgent tickets

Production-Level Architecture

Kafka for async message streaming

Redis for session caching

PostgreSQL for persistent storage

FastAPI REST/WS API for ingestion and dashboard

Docker & Docker Compose for development

Kubernetes deployment for scaling

Logging, metrics, and tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry)

3️⃣ Target Users

Customer support teams in banks, SaaS, e-commerce, fintech

Enterprise teams wanting to automate and improve response quality

Any organization needing real-time insights into customer messages

4️⃣ Detailed Workflow

Step 1: Message Ingestion

Producer agents read messages from channels

EmailProducer → polls IMAP inbox → Kafka

ChatProducer → API endpoint → Kafka

SocialProducer → polls API → Kafka

Messages are transformed into a standard schema:

{
  "id": "uuid",
  "source": "email|chat|social",
  "user": {"id": "u123", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"},
  "message": {"text": "I need help with my payment", "attachments": []},
  "metadata": {"received_at": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"}
}


Step 2: Master Agent

Consumes messages from Kafka

Validates message format

Spawns Worker Agents asynchronously

Tracks session context in Redis

Combines worker outputs into a final structured result

Step 3: Worker Agents

IntentAgent: Classifies intent (payment issue, subscription, technical problem)

SentimentAgent: Detects tone and urgency

KnowledgeAgent: Queries vector DB for relevant docs or previous tickets

ResponseAgent: Generates response using LLM and prompt templates

Step 4: Output

Structured response sent back to Kafka (response-events)

Dashboard reads events from DB to display real-time metrics and trends

Optional: send automated reply to the user (email/chat API)

5️⃣ NLP Tasks Included

Text Classification: Detect intent of the message

Sentiment Analysis: Gauge customer tone

NER / Entity Extraction: Optional extraction of names, accounts, or product types

Semantic Search / RAG: Embed knowledge base documents → search for relevant answers

Text Generation: LLM-generated response with context

6️⃣ Advanced Python Concepts

Async Programming: asyncio for producers and MasterAgent orchestration

Modular OOP Design: BaseAgent → MasterAgent / WorkerAgents, extensible for new agents

Event-Driven Architecture: Kafka producers & consumers

Retry & Error Handling: Decorators, retry loops for robust pipelines

Session Memory & Caching: Redis TTL-based storage

Pipeline Composition: Each agent runs independently but integrates into a workflow

Logging & Metrics: Structured logging, Prometheus metrics, Sentry error monitoring

Containerization & Deployment: Docker, Compose, K8s manifests

7️⃣ Production Readiness

Scalable: Multiple consumer instances → Kafka consumer groups

Observable: Metrics (latency, messages processed), logging, error tracking

Secure: Secrets management, TLS for Kafka, encrypted storage

Testable: Unit tests, integration tests with test containers

Modular & Extensible: Add new worker agents or channels without touching core logic

8️⃣ Deliverables

Multi-channel ingestion pipeline (Email, Chat, Social)

Master Agent orchestration layer

Worker agents (Intent, Sentiment, Knowledge, Response)

RAG vector search for knowledge retrieval

Dashboard for real-time analytics and metrics

Containerized environment (Docker/K8s)

Unit & Integration tests

Monitoring & logging setup

9️⃣ Impact / Use Cases

Reduces response time for customer support

Provides actionable insights for management

Allows companies to scale support operations without hiring more staff

Demonstrates state-of-the-art NLP + LLM usage in a real production scenario

Highly portfolio-worthy and hackathon-ready
